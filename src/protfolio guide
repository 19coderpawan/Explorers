/*How to Download 3D model in your pc and then how to import that  modle in your application */

1. Frist step is to go to the sketchfab.com website there you can get lots of 3D models both paid and free ones
   just download the free ones you want to use in your program.

2. Once you have download the model you will see that a zip file was download extract that zip file you will 
    come across some files but you cant use those files directly or the model directly. So to import that gtlf file
    into our program you have to import firstly gltf pipeline "npm install -g gltf-pipeline" globally using your 
    terminal just open your cmd and copy the import code for gltf from github into cmd . 
    What actually does this package does is that it takes all the files, including textures from the 3d model
    folder and create another new gltf file which further can we converted into a jsx file which we can use in our
    react .

3. to create new gltf file you need to get into your model folder first using the command line then use the 
   gltf-pipeline -i model.gltf -o modelDraco.gltf -d this command by replacing gltf file name and folder and then 
   simply press enter . A new gltf file must be created into your folder.

4.Now you just have to convert that gltf file into a jsx file. but for some reason this method is not working please
  use the second method it's working fine.   



******However if the the above process does not work you can simply follow this command 
1 .C:\Users\Pawan\Downloads\avengers_-_endgame> npx gltfjsx scene.gltf

2. once you have you jsx file simply transfer your bin,gltf,textures folder and jsx file in the project . your bin and gltf file
   should in the public folder and your jsx file should be in the component folder .

3. Now , finally simply import that jsx file in the file you want to use it and that's it . but remember that your
   paths should be correct everywhere like in the gltf file change the uri of the textures to use the textures.
   and in the jsx file you must specifi the folder name of the gltf file to use it.
   And thats all thank your.
